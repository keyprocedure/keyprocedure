### Core Features
- **Memory-Layout Preserving Clone Operator**  
  Built a new clone operator with a portable kernel and integrated across ARM, Apple’s Core ML, and Qualcomm backends; preventing optimization-induced output errors in production [[PR #12974](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/12974)]  
- **BatchNorm–Linear Graph Fusion Pass**  
  Developed a graph transformation that fuses BatchNorm into Linear layers, reducing computational overhead and improving CPU model efficiency [[PR #11805](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11805)]  
- **Dynamic Quantization for 2D Convolutions**  
  Enabled quantization support for conv2d operators, reducing memory footprint and improving edge device performance [[PR #10347](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10347)]  
- **Android API via JNI**  
  Created an API enabling developers to query supported operators and backends directly from native C++ runtime [[PR #11042](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11042)]  
- **Memory-Mapped File Loading**  
  Implemented direct memory reads into caller buffers, reducing model load times [[PR #11654](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11654)]  

### Reliability & Safety
- **Logging Safety Tests**  
  Added safeguards against uninitialized outputs, improving runtime reliability [[PR #9762](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/9762)]  
- **Mixed Precision Inference Guardrails**  
  Added checks to prevent model failures under mixed dtypes [[PR #9612](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/9612)]  
- **Input Validation for Model Execution**  
  Strengthened runtime safety by preventing silent memory corruptions [[PR #10701](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10701)]  

### Tooling & CI
- **Platform Detection and Updated Build Instructions**  
  Improved source-built PyTorch integration and documentation [[PR #10652](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10652)]  
- **Formatter and Lint Workflow Expansion**  
  Expanded CI coverage and quality [[PR #12256](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/12256)]
