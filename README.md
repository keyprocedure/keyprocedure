### Core Features
- **Memory-Layout Preserving Clone Operator and Portable Kernel**  
  Integrated across ARM, Apple’s Core ML, and Qualcomm backends; preventing optimization-induced output errors in production [[PR #12974](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/12974)]  
- **BatchNorm–Linear Graph Fusion Pass**  
  Reduced computational overhead and improved CPU model efficiency [[PR #11805](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11805)]  
- **Dynamic Quantization for 2D Convolutions**  
  Reduced memory footprint and improved edge device performance [[PR #10347](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10347)]  
- **Android API via JNI**  
  Enabled developers to query supported operators and backends directly from native C++ runtime [[PR #11042](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11042)]  
- **Memory-Mapped File Loading**  
  Enabled direct reads into caller buffers, reducing model load times [[PR #11654](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/11654)]  

### Reliability & Safety
- **Logging Safety Tests**  
  Safeguarded against uninitialized outputs, improving runtime reliability [[PR #9762](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/9762)]  
- **Mixed Precision Inference Guardrails**  
  Prevented model failures under mixed dtypes [[PR #9612](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/9612)]  
- **Input Validation for Model Execution**  
  Strengthened runtime safety by preventing silent memory corruptions [[PR #10701](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10701)]  

### Tooling & CI
- **Platform Detection and Updated Build Instructions**  
  Improved source-built PyTorch integration and documentation [[PR #10652](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/10652)]  
- **Formatter and Lint Workflow Expansion**  
  Improved CI quality and consistency [[PR #12256](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/12256)]
